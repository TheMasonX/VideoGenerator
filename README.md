## Overview:
Originally planned as a tool to stitch together images into video in order to explore how to work with video data in .NET, but this it's proving difficult to find a good video conversion library, so it has somewhat pivoted towards being more of a general purpose test platform for developing a modern desktop application. Eventually intend to spin off a separate application framework libarary based on this work and continue the video generation research in this repo.
